# M2 Domain Service
## Project description
M2 Domain is a Blockcahain base domain service build on Polygon Pos chain, that help individual, organisation to register their domain name on the smart contract and own it. It allows suers to register a domain name and associate it with a digital asset as NFT which is a digital representation of the domain name created insted of a long complex address.
The domain is mapped such that only the owner of the domain can have access to the editing feature, except a full ownership has been transfer to another user.
## Contract Structure
The Domains contract inherits from ERC721URIStorage, which is an OpenZeppelin library contract that implements the ERC721 interface for non-fungible tokens with a URI-based metadata extension.

## State Variables
### The contract has several state variables:

1. `owner`: the address of the contract owner, who has the ability to withdraw funds from the contract.
2. `_tokenIds`: a Counters.Counter object that is used to keep track of the current token ID when minting new tokens.
3. `names`: a mapping of token IDs to domain names.
4. `records`: a mapping of domain names to records.
5. `domains`: a mapping of domain names to owner addresses.
6. `tld`: a string representing the top-level domain for all registered domains.
7. `SVG_PART_ONE`: a string containing SVG data for a graphical representation of the domain name.
## Functions
### The contract has several functions:

1. `constructor`: sets the contract owner and top-level domain.
2. `register`: allows a user to register a domain name by minting a new token with the given name.
3. `setRecord`: allows the owner of a domain to set the record associated with the domain.
4. `getRecord`: allows anyone to retrieve the record associated with a domain.
5. `transfer`: allows the owner of a domain to transfer ownership of the domain to another Ethereum address
6. `getDomainOwner`: allows anyone to retrieve the owner address associated with a domain.
7. `tokenURI`: overrides the tokenURI function from the ERC721URIStorage contract to return metadata for a given token ID.
## Modifiers
### The contract has two modifiers:
In addition, the contract includes several modifiers for access control:

1. `onlyOwner`: restricts access to functions that can only be called by the contract owner (specified in the owner variable)
2. `isAuthorized`: restricts access to functions that can only be called by the owner of a particular domain
3. `unregistered`: can be applied to functions that require a domain name that has not already been registered.
## Libraries
### The contract imports two external libraries:

1. `Base64`: contains functions for encoding and decoding base64 strings.
2. `StringUtils`: contains string manipulation functions.

## Running Project Locally

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo
### Smart Contract
1. `cd domainscontract` run `npm install` to install all the dependencies 
2. After cloning the repo, go to [Quicknode][(https://www.quicknode.com/endpoints)](https://www.quicknode.com/endpoints) to make an account and generate your API endpoint key
3. Rename the `.env.example` file on the root of the project to `.env`, then paste your API endpont key in the `.env` file
4. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai` to deploy the contract to the polygon mumbai network
5. Your result of successful deployment should look like this:
```sh
Contract deployed to: 0x0AB61D0c7286c5c12Ef0eaaFD90B446e643DFe26
Minted domain grandidah.m2
Set record for grandidah.m2
Owner of domain grandidah: 0xC475cbd2225B641266C2CB9d0151982C3596085C
Contract balance: 0.1
```
### Frontend 
1. From the project root directory:
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to start the project
4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the project running

## How to use

1. Go to [https://domain-serviceon-polygon.vercel.app/](https://domain-serviceon-polygon.vercel.app/)
2. Click on Connect wallet to connect your wallet and switch to mumbai
3. Enter the domain you want to mint, provide the Domain description, and click 'mint' to continue
4. Your domain will show as the recent mint domain on the dashboard
5. Click on the Domain to see your digital representation of the domain on opensea testnet
