# M2 Domain Service
## Project description
M2 Domain is a Blockcahain base domain service build on Polygon Pos chain, that help individual, organisation to register their domain name on the smart contract and own it. It allows suers to register a domain name and associate it with a digital asset as NFT which is a digital representation of the domain name created insted of a long complex address.
The domain is mapped such that only the owner of the domain can have access to the editing feature, except a full ownership has been transfer to another user.
## Contract Structure
The Domains contract inherits from ERC721URIStorage, which is an OpenZeppelin library contract that implements the ERC721 interface for non-fungible tokens with a URI-based metadata extension.

## State Variables
### The contract has several state variables:

1. `owner`: the address of the contract owner, who has the ability to withdraw funds from the contract.
2. `_tokenIds`: a Counters.Counter object that is used to keep track of the current token ID when minting new tokens.
3. `names`: a mapping of token IDs to domain names.
4. `records`: a mapping of domain names to records.
5. `domains`: a mapping of domain names to owner addresses.
6. `tld`: a string representing the top-level domain for all registered domains.
7. `SVG_PART_ONE`: a string containing SVG data for a graphical representation of the domain name.
## Functions
### The contract has several functions:

1. `constructor`: sets the contract owner and top-level domain.
2. `register`: allows a user to register a domain name by minting a new token with the given name.
3. `setRecord`: allows the owner of a domain to set the record associated with the domain.
4. `getRecord`: allows anyone to retrieve the record associated with a domain.
5. `transfer`: allows the owner of a domain to transfer ownership of the domain to another Ethereum address
6. `getDomainOwner`: allows anyone to retrieve the owner address associated with a domain.
7. `tokenURI`: overrides the tokenURI function from the ERC721URIStorage contract to return metadata for a given token ID.
## Modifiers
### The contract has two modifiers:
In addition, the contract includes several modifiers for access control:

1. `onlyOwner`: restricts access to functions that can only be called by the contract owner (specified in the owner variable)
2. `isAuthorized`: restricts access to functions that can only be called by the owner of a particular domain
3. `unregistered`: can be applied to functions that require a domain name that has not already been registered.
## Libraries
### The contract imports two external libraries:

1. `Base64`: contains functions for encoding and decoding base64 strings.
2. `StringUtils`: contains string manipulation functions.
